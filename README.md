# Bike_Sharing
## Overview of the analysis.
  * In this analysis we are trying to see if a bike sharing program taking place in NYC can be replicated and utilized outside of NYC. In order to do this we are using CitiBike data to conduct our analysis and create visualizations.
## Results 
* Checkout times for users. The graph shows that a majority of rides are within the 0 to 10 minute mark. With very few bike rides lasting around an hour.

 Checkout times by gender. This graph shows the seperation between male, female, and unknown riders. It shows that the ride duration is relatively unaffected by the gender of the rider. With those times remaining around th 5-10 minute mark.
